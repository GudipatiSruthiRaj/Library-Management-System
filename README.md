# Library-Management-System
#**Project Overview**

This is a simple Library Management System built in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
It allows users to:

View all books in the library

Issue (borrow) a book

Return a book

Exit the system

# Features

Book Management → Add, issue, return books

Encapsulation → Book data is private, accessed via methods

Abstraction → Library provides simple methods to manage books

Association (HAS-A) → Library contains multiple books

Polymorphism (Optional Extension) → Extend User class into Student or Librarian

Console-based user interface with menu options

# OOP Concepts Used

Class & Object → Book, User, Library, Main

Encapsulation → private fields with getters & setters

Abstraction → issueBook() and returnBook() hide details

Association (HAS-A) → Library has many books

Inheritance & Polymorphism (can be extended)
